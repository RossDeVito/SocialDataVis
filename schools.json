As a result, the mathematical sciences are celebrated at this school.","neighborhood":"Claremont-Bathgate","location":"1595 Bathgate Avenue, Bronx NY 10457 (40.839508, -73.901774)","phone_number":"718-466-7800","fax_number":"718-466-7801","school_email":"jrivera71@schools.nyc.gov","website":"www.AMSbronx.org","grades2018":"6-12","total_students":622,"start_time":"8:30am","end_time":"3:30pm","addtl_info1":"Community Service Expected; Internships; Uniform","extracurricular_activities":"Art, Ceramics, Chess, Dance, Classical, Digital, Drama, Graphic, Hip-Hop, Japanese, Jazz, Literature Circles, Math League, Mock Trial, Music, Peer Counseling, Piano, Production, Robotics, Siemens Science Research Class, Step, Student Advisory, Student Government, Student Newspaper, Tutoring, Visual Arts, Vocal, Wilderness\/Camping","psal_sports_boys":"Baseball, Basketball, Cross Country, Wrestling","psal_sports_girls":"Basketball, Flag Football, Softball, Wrestling","psal_sports_coed":"Double Dutch","school_sports":"Boys: JV Basketball; Girls: JV and Varsity Basketball, Double Dutch, Volleyball; Co-ed: Tennis, Track","graduation_rate":0.878000021,"attendance_rate":0.899999976,"pct_stu_enough_variety":0.810000002,"college_career_rate":0.558000028,"pct_stu_safe":0.870000005,"girls":false,"boys":false,"pbat":false,"international":false,"specialized":false,"transfer":false,"ptech":false,"earlycollege":false,"geoeligibility":null,"primary_address_line_1":"1595 Bathgate Avenue","city":"Bronx","Postcode":10457,"state_code":"NY","Latitude":40.83951,"Longitude":-73.9018,"Community Board":3,"Council District":16,"Census Tract":167,"BIN":2009555.0,"BBL":2029130001.0,"NTA":"Claremont-Bathgate                                                         ","Borough":"BRONX    ","NTA_lower":"claremont-bathgate","nta":"BX01 Claremont-Bathgate","measure":"Percent","Unemployment Rate":22.4234234234,"Households Less than $10,000":26.2414948715,"Households With cash public assistance income":13.8620899766,"Households With Food Stamp\/SNAP bnfts in the past 12 mo":53.6508581294,"Vacant housing units":6.4506935208,"Lacking complete plumbing facilities":0.7108764091,"GRAPI 35.0 percent or more":43.1547287513,"Population 25 years and over  Less than 9th grade":19.1045858256,"Percent high school graduate or higher":56.9451996858,"Percent bachelor's degree or higher":8.5493323666,"NTA_code":"BX01","NTA_name":"Claremont-Bathgate","geoeligibility_b":false,"community_school":false,"uniforms":true,"type":0} {"DBN":"09X250","School Name":"Eximius College Preparatory Academy: A College Boa","Rigorous Instruction - Percent Positive":0.83,"Collaborative Teachers - Percent Positive":0.89,"Supportive Environment - Percent Positive":0.71,"Effective School Leadership - Percent Positive":0.94,"Strong Family-Community Ties - Percent Positive":0.89,"Trust - Percent Positive":0.91,"Average Grade 8 English Proficiency":2.587,"Average Grade 8 Math Proficiency":2.228,"Percent English Language Learners":0.113,"Percent Students with Disabilities":0.222,"Percent Self-Contained":0.005,"Economic Need Index":0.79,"Percent Overage\/ Undercredited":0.074,"Percent in Temp Housing":0.125,"Years of principal experience at this school":5.8,"Percent of teachers with 3 or more years of experience":0.867,"Student Attendance Rate":0.854,"Percent of Students Chronically Absent":0.429,"School Name_1":"Eximius College Preparatory Academy: A College Boa","Student Achievement - Section Score":4.06,"Metric Value - 4-Year Graduation Rate":0.886,"Metric Value - Postsecondary Enrollment Rate - 18 Months":0.744,"Metric Value - Postsecondary Enrollment Rate - 6 Months":0.568,"Metric Value - College and Career Preparatory Course Index":0.267,"Metric Value - 4-Year College Readiness Index":0.362,"School Name_2":"Eximius College Preparatory Academy: A College Boa","Metric Value - Average Score SAT Math":426.5,"Metric Value - Average Score SAT Reading and Writing":444.9,"Metric Value - % College Ready SAT Math":0.076,"Metric Value - % College Ready SAT Reading and Writing":0.219,"Metric Value - % test takers at college ready threshold Regents English":0.58,"Metric Value - % Passing an Industry-Recognized Technical Assessment":0.019,"school_name":"Eximius College Preparatory Academy: A College Board School","overview_paragraph":"Eximius College Preparatory Academy is dedicated to developing high-achieving students of good character who use academic, technological and social skills to inspire others and contribute to their community.

We give our students experiences in local healthcare settings before they graduate. Students gain practical skills including CPR and first aid, explore careers through 11th grade internships at local medical centers, and take early college coursework with our university partners. These hands-on opportunities both provide a context for language acquisition and allow students to use their native language as an asset in their service to the community.","neighborhood":"Elmhurst","location":"48-01 90th Street, Elmhurst NY 11373 (40.740824, -73.874129)","phone_number":"718-595-8600","fax_number":"718-595-8605","school_email":"cfinney2@schools.nyc.gov","website":"www.ihshealthsciences.org","grades2018":"9-12","total_students":232,"start_time":"8:30am","end_time":"3:30pm","addtl_info1":"Internships","extracurricular_activities":"DNA Research Team, Astronomy, Anime","psal_sports_boys":"Baseball, Basketball, Bowling, Cross Country, Outdoor Track, Soccer, Tennis, Volleyball, Wrestling","psal_sports_girls":"Basketball, Cross Country, Handball, Indoor Track, Outdoor Track, Soccer, Softball, Tennis, Volleyball","psal_sports_coed":"Cricket","school_sports":null,"graduation_rate":null,"attendance_rate":0.930000007,"pct_stu_enough_variety":0.889999986,"college_career_rate":null,"pct_stu_safe":0.819999993,"girls":false,"boys":false,"pbat":true,"international":true,"specialized":false,"transfer":false,"ptech":false,"earlycollege":false,"geoeligibility":null,"primary_address_line_1":"48-01 90th Street","city":"Elmhurst","Postcode":11373,"state_code":"NY","Latitude":40.74082,"Longitude":-73.8741,"Community Board":4,"Council District":25,"Census Tract":461,"BIN":4045629.0,"BBL":4018490001.0,"NTA":"Elmhurst                                                                   ","Borough":"QUEENS   ","NTA_lower":"elmhurst","nta":"QN29 Elmhurst","measure":"Percent","Unemployment Rate":6.7260921699,"Households Less than $10,000":8.1734960767,"Households With cash public assistance income":4.0504213891,"Households With Food Stamp\/SNAP bnfts in the past 12 mo":15.6676838128,"Vacant housing units":5.8903969095,"Lacking complete plumbing facilities":0.4468177855,"GRAPI 35.0 percent or more":52.416097342,"Population 25 years and over  Less than 9th grade":17.7729110512,"Percent high school graduate or higher":68.7634770889,"Percent bachelor's degree or higher":23.7601078167,"NTA_code":"QN29","NTA_name":"Elmhurst","geoeligibility_b":false,"community_school":false,"uniforms":false,"type":6} {"DBN":"24Q264","School Name":"Academy of Finance and Enterprise","Rigorous Instruction - Percent Positive":0.82,"Collaborative Teachers - Percent Positive":0.89,"Supportive Environment - Percent Positive":0.79,"Effective School Leadership - Percent Positive":0.93,"Strong Family-Community Ties - Percent Positive":0.88,"Trust - Percent Positive":0.91,"Average Grade 8 English Proficiency":3.019,"Average Grade 8 Math Proficiency":2.935,"Percent English Language Learners":0.062,"Percent Students with Disabilities":0.123,"Percent Self-Contained":0.002,"Economic Need Index":0.545,"Percent Overage\/ Undercredited":0.039,"Percent in Temp Housing":0.053,"Years of principal experience at this school":5.0,"Percent of teachers with 3 or more years of experience":0.828,"Student Attendance Rate":0.931,"Percent of Students Chronically Absent":0.236,"School Name_1":"Academy of Finance and Enterprise","Student Achievement - Section Score":4.07,"Metric Value - 4-Year Graduation Rate":0.943,"Metric Value - Postsecondary Enrollment Rate - 18 Months":0.935,"Metric Value - Postsecondary Enrollment Rate - 6 Months":0.774,"Metric Value - College and Career Preparatory Course Index":0.864,"Metric Value - 4-Year College Readiness Index":0.849,"School Name_2":"Academy of Finance and Enterprise","Metric Value - Average Score SAT Math":526.7,"Metric Value - Average Score SAT Reading and Writing":514.5,"Metric Value - % College Ready SAT Math":0.496,"Metric Value - % College Ready SAT Reading and Writing":0.676,"Metric Value - % test takers at college ready threshold Regents English":0.9,"Metric Value - % Passing an Industry-Recognized Technical Assessment":0.443,"school_name":"Academy of Finance and Enterprise","overview_paragraph":"The mission of the Academy of Finance and Enterprise is to provide students with an academic, business\/financial, and technology program that is challenging, student centered, and project-based.
